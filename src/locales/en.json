    "description": "The app's primary purpose is to analyze river water to provide accurate information on its quality, particularly for outdoor swimming enthusiasts. It is equipped with sensors that measure pH, turbidity, temperature, and water conductivity. In addition to these measurements, an analysis of videos taken by users allows for the calculation of current flow. Using artificial intelligence, the app is able to predict the evolution of certain variables over a seven-day period, thus providing the user with better anticipation of water conditions."
